# CSE142-Spring2021-Assessment6-YazInterpreter
Take-home Assessment 6: Yaz Interpreter

# Program Behavior
In this assessment, you will create an interpreter for the programming language YazLang. (This language was named a former CSE 142 Head TA and Instructor, Ayaz, who led development of the language and this assignment.) When interpreting a YazLang file, the program prompts the user for input and output file names (user input is underlined in the Sample Execution examples above). Then the program reads and executes the YazLang commmands in the input file and outputs the results to a different file. The user can later view the output file that was created or quit the program.
